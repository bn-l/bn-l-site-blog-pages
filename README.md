# Clean starter blog 
Uses [metalsmith](https://github.com/metalsmith/metalsmith) and [pug](https://pugjs.org/language/)

This starting base is basically completely unstyled and can be adapted or used as is (for a sleek minimal look).

It doesn't look like much but thanks to metalsmith, all you need to do is write markdown file and they'll be converted into blog posts and nicely formatted like above.

Note: uses UK DD-MM-YY date style in [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/)
