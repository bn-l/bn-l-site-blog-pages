## Relationships



### Inheritance:

<img src="images/inheritance.min.svg" alt="inheritance.min" class="svgImg" />

**Each SmellyRat is an instance of an Animal.** A SmellyRat will have the usual things Animals have (like a heart, brain) but a SmellyRat adds its own character: Smell, indefinable ratness, fur.



### Association

#### Bidirectional:

<img src="images/bidirectional.min3.svg" alt="bidirectional.min3" class="svgImg" />

**Both classes have a association with each other.** The opposite end of the connection describes the relationship with *roles*: SmellyRat is a *resident*, Sewer is a *home*, and *multiplicity*: There are potentially *1* to many \* SmellyRats residing a Sewer, and just 1 Sewer is *home* for to a SmellyRat.

#### Uni-directional:

<img src="images/unidirectional.min.svg" alt="unidirectional.min" class="svgImg" />

**Only one class needs to know about the other.** A Plague does not reference a SmellyRat specifically in its implementation. A but the SmellyRat's public Infection is a Plague type (sounds serious).



### Interface:

<img src="images/interface.min.svg" alt="interface.min" class="svgImg" />

**SmellyRat and LabRat are implementations of a Rat.**



### Aggregation:

<img src="images/aggregation.min.svg" alt="aggregation.min" class="svgImg" />

**An implant is a <u>part</u> of a LabRat but is not necessarily destroyed when the LabRat is**. Another example: A Car with 4 Wheels. The Wheels are *parts* of the car but can live outside it independently.



### Composition:

<img src="images/composition.min.svg" alt="composition.min" class="svgImg" />

**A StrangeGrowth cannot exist without a LabRat.** Like the aggregation, a LabRat can have many StrangeGrowth parts but if the LabRat parent goes so do the StrangeGrowth instances (poor Rat).



### Dependency:

<img src="images/dependency.min.svg" alt="dependency.min" class="svgImg" />

**SmellyRat depends on the API of Smell**. To emitOdor a SmellyRat accesses the properties of a Smell. If Smell changes, SmellyRat might have to also.
