How can it be approaching 202**3**? That's 23. Not 20. Or 21. *Three*. Three since the start of 2020. The time has gone by very quickly.

## Resolutions for 2023

1. 10x more humility
2. Listening twice as much
3. Reaching out to people more often and checking up with them. Even when, in the moment, it seems like an imposition.
4. Asserting feelings with more courage
5. 20x the courageâ€”especially of the unknown.
